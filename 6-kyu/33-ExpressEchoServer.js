//* Express: Echo Server
// In this Express exercise, your task is to create an app that responds to GET and POST requests on the / route. 
// The responses will echo a message string from the request.

//* GET /
// This route will read the message parameter and send a JSON response containing the echoed message value. 
// The response should have a 200 status.

// An example query string is ?message=hello which would be echoed as {"message": "hello"}. An empty string, ?message=, 
// is valid and should be echoed normally.

// Respond with a 422 status and the JSON {"error": "'message' was not provided"} when no query parameter message exists.

// Respond with a 422 status and the JSON {"error": "'message' was not a string"} when the message was provided, 
// but of a type other than a string.

//* POST /
// This route will parse the request body as JSON and echo a response containing the value from the "message" 
// key of the request. The JSON response is in the same format as the GET above: {"message": "some message"}. 
// Set a 200 status on the response to indicate that the request was OK. An empty string ("message": "") is valid 
// and should be echoed.

// Respond with a 422 status when no "message" key exists, or if the message type is other than a string. 
// The JSON errors for these cases are identical to those used in GET.

// For either method, a request is still valid if additional parameters or keys are present in the query or JSON body. 
// You can ignore them and echo message as normal.

//* Notes
// Please use the variable name app to implement your server. Don't use app.listen() to start the Express server; 
// the test suite will invoke the route handlers directly on the app object.

// Your solution file is automatically included with the test suite, so no export is necessary.

// Test input strings consist of alphanumeric characters and spaces.

// If you're not familiar with the Express concepts needed to complete this kata, feel free to reference the 
// documentation and other resources as you build your solution.
